LizardFS is a networking, distributed file system.

It spreads data over several physical locations (servers), which are visible to a user as one resource (available through FUSE).

LizardFS is fault tolerant at data level, not completely on metadata level.

The goals behind LizardFS are:

    Providing free:
        Highly Reliable,
        Highly Scalable,
        Highly Available,
        Highly Secure,
        Highly Efficient file system solution.
    Adapting modern agile development of distributed system in C++:
        git - https://github.com/lizardfs/lizardfs,
        jenkins (for access please contact contact@lizardfs.org),
        gerrit (for access please contact contact@lizardfs.org),
        unit testing.
    Active cooperation with open source community.
    Developing test infrastructure standards for distributed file systems.

LizardFS is a fork of moosefs.

Motivations behind creating this fork are:

    rare updates of git repository
    lack of community (only 2 developpers made commits to public git repository at sourceforge)
    increase in the number of possible contributors with a simultaneous lack of response on the part of moosefs mainteners
    our ability to perfect the tool
